abstract: Flask-Admin 1.0.7
---

After almost 6 months of development time (with breaks, obviously), I'm happy to announce new version of the Flask-Admin package.

So, what's new?

Python 3 Support
================

Flask-Admin (and Flask-BabelEx) are now Python 3 compatible. I only tested them with Python 3.3, so can't guarantee that
they'll work on older Python 3 versions.

All Flask-Admin features work as expected except of MongoEngine and Peewee backends, as their dependencies
are not Python 3 compatible yet.

No More Flask-WTF
=================

Flask-Admin is no longer uses Flask-WTF for the forms. This was done for few reasons: Flask-WTF was undergoing some significant
API changes, was not Python 3 compatible and was additional dependency that I had to manage.

Starting with 1.0.7, Flask-Admin will use vanilla WTForms *Form* class with option to use any other base class if required.

Redis CLI
=========

Now it is possible to run [redis](http://redis.io/) commands straight from Flask-Admin interface. Very convenient when you don't have access to redis console for whatever reason.
Looks like this:

</a>

Example is [here](https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/tree/master/examples/rediscli).

AJAX Foreign Key Loading
========================

Starting from this version, it is possible to populate foreign-key drop-downs using AJAX calls. This feature
should significantly improve Flask-Admin performance when working with large datasets.

Here is snippet from [SQLAlchemy example](https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/blob/master/examples/sqla/simple.py)

{% highlight python %}
class PostAdmin(sqla.ModelView):
	# .. skipped for brevity
	form_ajax_refs = {
        'user': {
            'fields': (User.username, User.email)
        },
        'tags': {
            'fields': (Tag.name,)
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, *user* and *tags* are foreign keys in the *Post* model. Without *form_ajax_refs*, Flask-Admin
will pre-populate drop-downs with all possible users and all possible tags. If there are lots of users in the database
and few thousand tags defined, create and edit pages will be huge.

With *form_ajax_refs* in place, Flask-Admin will make AJAX calls to get list of visible based on user input. For *User* model
it will filter related models against *username* and *email* fields. For *Tag* model, it will filter on *name* field.

AJAX data loader is very configurable - it is possible to implement custom filtering logic if necessary.

Form Rendering Rules
====================

Flask-Admin had very simple form rendering logic since the beginning - it was looping over form fields and rendering
them one by one.

In this version, form rendering is now separate from the form definition. It is possible to rearrange fields, add HTML
in-between fields without changing templates, override how fields are rendered and so on.

Here is simplified example that shows how to use the rules:
{% highlight python %}
from flask.ext.admin.form import rules
from flask.ext.admin.contrib import sqla

class RuleView(sqla.ModelView):
    form_create_rules = [
        # Header and four fields. Email field will go above phone field.
        rules.FieldSet(('first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'phone'), 'Personal'),
        # Separate header and few fields
        rules.Header('Address'),
        rules.Field('address'),
        # String is resolved to form field, so there's no need to explicitly use *rules.Field*
        'city',
        'zip',
        # Show macro from Flask-Admin lib.html (it is included with 'lib' prefix)
        rules.Container('rule_demo.wrap', rules.Field('notes'))
    ]

    # Use same rule set for edit page
    form_edit_rules = form_create_rules
{% endhighlight %}

This is snippet from [forms example](https://github.com/mrjoes/flask-admin/blob/master/examples/forms/simple.py).
When executed, form will look like:

</a>

Documentation is [here](http://flask-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/form_rules/).

MongoEngine Improvements
========================

There are few new features in MongoEngine backend. Biggest ones - nested document configuration and GridFS support
for file and image uploads.

Nested document configuration
-----------------------------

Before this version, it was impossible to change form generation options for embedded documents. Now
there is *form_subdocuments* field that configures Flask-Admin behavior when scaffolding forms for child models.

For example:
{% highlight python %}
class Name(db.EmbeddedDocument):
    name = db.StringField(max_length=20, required=True)
    code = db.StringField(max_length=10)

class Post(db.Product):
    info = db.StringField(max_length=20, required=True)
    name = db.EmbeddedDocumentField(Name)

class PostView(ModelView):
    form_subdocuments = {
        'name': {
            'form_rules': ('name', rules.HTML('<hr>'), 'code')
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

GridFS support
--------------

There are two new WTForms fields that handle file and image uploads and store them as GridFS objects in the document.
They work in a same way as file-based file and image upload fields which will be explained below.

Inline Model Improvements
=========================

Before version 1.0.7, inline models were bolted on - hard to configure, not flexible, it was impossible to preprocess
inline models before saving, etc.

In this version, inline model logic was moved to separate WTForm fields and whole inline model subsystem is much more
configurable now.

FileUploadField and ImageUploadField
====================================

These two fields solve most common task when managing images and files: they handle file uploads, put them into dedicated
directory and store relative path to the uploaded file in a model field.

*ImageUploadField*, with help of PIL, can verify if uploaded image is valid and generate image thumbnail.

<a href="/shared/posts/flask-admin-107/image-upload.png">
  <img src="/shared/posts/flask-admin-107/image-upload.png" alt="ImageUploadField example"></img>
</a>

These fields are very configurable and should cover most of the file and image related operations.
Check [documentation](http://flask-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/mod_form_upload/) for more information.

Additional form columns
=======================

New *form_extra_columns* allows adding new WTForm fields to automatically generated model form. It is no longer
necessary to override *scaffold_form* to contribute fields.
